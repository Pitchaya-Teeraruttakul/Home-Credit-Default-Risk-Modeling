# Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Modeling

# Project Overview 👀

This repository provides an end-to-end implementation of a Probability of Default (PD) modeling framework aligned with IFRS 9 requirements, Home Credit Default Risk dataset. It covers data preparation, feature engineering, WOE binning and IV analysis, logistic regression PD modeling, segmentation/scorecard design, IFRS 9 segmentation criteria, calibration of PIT and lifetime PD, and ECL computation.

# Objectives 🪵

    - Build a robust logistic regression PD model using WOE-transformed features
    - Calibrate Point-in-Time (PIT) and Lifetime PD, incorporating macroeconomic adjustments
    - Apply IFRS 9 segmentation criteria to derive staging buckets
    - Compute Expected Credit Loss (ECL) under IFRS 9 frameworks (12‑month and Lifetime PD)
    - Showcase full credit risk modeling workflow for portfolio-level risk assessment

# Data Preparation 🧹

    - application_train.csv: Main table with borrower-level features.
    - bureau.csv: All client's previous credits provided by other financial institutions that were reported to Credit Bureau
    - bureau_balance.csv: Monthly balances of previous credits in Credit Bureau.
    - previous_application.csv: All previous applications for Home Credit loans of clients who have loans in our sample.

    In the dataExploration.ipynb, I perform a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and cleaning step based on the raw CSV files.
    Key analyses and actions include:
        - Missing Value Analysis
        - Univariate Distribution Checks
        - Categorical Value Cleaning
        - Basic Flag Features
        - Merging External Tables
    and etc.
    After cleaning and merging, the consolidated DataFrame contains 307,511 rows and approximately 98 features.

# Feature Engineering ❓

    In the featureSelectionAndEDA.ipynb, we expand upon EDA to create and select predictive features:
        - Correlation & Multicollinearity Checks
        - Ratio & Scale Features
        - Employment & Demographic Features
        - Aggregation

    WOE Binning & IV Analysis --> Binning Strategy and encoding all the essential features, ready for modeling
    also Compute Information Value (IV) to select predictive variables.

# Modeling 🐌

    In model.ipynb, we implement, train, and evaluate a logistic regression PD model on WOE-transformed features:
        perform logistic regression --> to find raw PD


    Evaluate model using AUC, KS statistic, calibration plots, and confusion matrix.

# Post Modeling 🐌

    PIT PDs Calibration (calibrate Raw PDs to Point-In-Time PDs)
        Convert logistic regression coefficients into a points-based scorecard.
        Calibrate PIT PD to align with empirical 12‑month default rates.


    Scorecard & Segmentation (IFRS 9 Segment to Portfolio Level and )
        Define segmentation buckets based on score bands.


    TTC PDs and Project Lifetime PDs Calibration (calibrate PIT PDs to IFRS9 PDs)
        To identify and segment records to IFRS9 Stage

    Assign Stage 1 (12‑month PD), Stage 2 (significant increase in credit risk), Stage 3 (defaulted) per IFRS 9 rules.

    ECL Computation (Uses result IFRS9 PDs to calculate Expeced-Credit-Loss)

        Combine EAD (Exposure at Default), LGD (Loss Given Default), and PD (12‑month or Lifetime) to compute ECL:
        EL = PD * EAD * LGD

        ECL = sum(EL) along Portfolio
        to be credit cost of Bank

- the small unique exposture < 30 records make global quantile bins and assign to relative bucket because i dont want to drop any row of post model data!!

then do back test on a hold-out year or out-of-time sample
Document your segmentation rules, thresholds, and calibration approach for audit
then integrate EDA LGD ECL
